\paragraph{Lectures.}

I'll prmarily present the course material during the lectures.
The lecture format will be updated from previous offerings, following the same
general format.
Lectures may be reorganized at my discretion.
The book
``\href{https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/}
       {Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces}''
by \href{http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi}{Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau}
and \href{http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~dusseau}{Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau}
will complement the lectures.

\paragraph{Labs.}

Submissions are done using Git.
We will provide students with a Git repository, and you'll be required to
push your code there for submission.
Your submission time will be recorded, the state of your repository at the due
date will be considered your submission.
You will be given 4 late days to use due to unforeseen circumstances.
There will be no penalty for using late days.
If you use 5 late days, your lowest lab grade will be halved.
Any additional late days will cause you to receive a 0 on your latest lab and
you will recoup the late days.
I will try to give you the option that results in the highest grade.

\paragraph{Discussion.}

This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion.
I believe in and encourage public discussion.
For any private manners please email the myself or a TA instead.

\paragraph{Academic Honesty.}

I expect you to follow the
\href{https://deanofstudents.ucla.edu/individual-student-code}
     {Student Conduct Code}
and the
\href{https://deanofstudents.ucla.edu/group-student-code}
     {Student Group Conduct Code}.
I will not tolerate any cheating.
It only hurts your learning, and your follow students.
This includes posting your course Git repository to the public
(e.g. on GitHub).
Any cheating recieves a grade of 0 and disciplinary action.
Note that this policy applies outside of this quarter as well.
