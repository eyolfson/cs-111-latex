    Filling the basic fields of processes are done for you --- \texttt{data} and \texttt{size}

    \vspace{2em}

    There's a doubly linked list set up for you

    \hspace{2em} \texttt{man TAILQ\_INIT}

    \hspace{4em} It's overkill for now, but you might need it later

    Ask any questions about this, or anything that hasn't been clear up to this

    \frametitle{We Did Implementation Today}

    Implemented SRTF in C:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Reports the average waiting and response time
      \item (Hopefully) Handles Edge Cases
      \item Matches the results in the lecture
    \end{itemize}
